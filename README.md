# Maintenance page

This is a generic maintenance page that can be used for most web projects. It is hopefully reasonably fun enough to play with that visitors are distracted a bit from the fact that the site is down.

Part of its design is that it compiles to a single HTML file that can be easily forwarded to by a reverse proxy or similar.
